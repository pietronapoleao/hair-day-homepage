# Hair Day - Homepage Project

This is the final project for the **"HTML and CSS in Depth"** course by Meta.

## About

This project was developed as part of the course's final assessment. The task was to create a homepage for one of four fictional clients, based on their personas and business characteristics. I chose **Hair Day**, a boutique hair salon based in Madison, Wisconsin, that specializes in bold coloring techniques, modern cuts, and personalized beauty services.

## The Challenge

The exercise required more than building a functional layout ‚Äî I had to carefully consider:

- How to structure the content using semantic HTML tags.
- How to style and enhance the layout with CSS, including Flexbox and grid.
- How to organize the code, assets, and user experience.
- How to apply interactivity with selectors and smooth animations.
- How to make the site visually compelling and aligned with the client‚Äôs brand.

## Development Process

I started by analyzing the Hair Day persona. The brand embraces bold style, modern aesthetics, and a personalized, luxurious experience. Based on that, I designed a homepage that includes:

- Semantic HTML5 structure using `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
- A clean, responsive layout using **Flexbox** and **CSS grid**.
- A soft color palette derived from the Hair Day logo.
- Subtle hover effects, smooth transitions, and a mobile-friendly navigation menu.
- A **booking form** for clients to schedule appointments.
- Full responsiveness and interactivity via CSS and JavaScript.

All styles are managed in `styles.css`, and the site behavior is enhanced with a separate `script.js`.
